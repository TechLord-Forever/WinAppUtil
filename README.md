# WinAppUtil
WinAppDbg is perhaps one of the most underrated Windows binary instrumentation frameworks.

As I am learning how to use it, I have created some code to help me.

WinAppDbg is create by Mario Vilas:

- code: [https://github.com/MarioVilas/winappdbg][winappdbg-github]
- docs (read them): [https://winappdbg.readthedocs.io][winappdbg-docs]

## Usage
It's not a module yet. Copy the `winapputil` directory to your code and use `import winapputil`.

Until I add more code and usage, look at test04 for good usage.
